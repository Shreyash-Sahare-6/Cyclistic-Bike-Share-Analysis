# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis

This repository contains my analysis of Cyclistic bike-share data, focusing on understanding the differences between casual and member riders. The goal of this analysis is to provide data-driven insights that can inform marketing strategies to increase annual memberships.

As a junior data analyst on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, I was tasked with analyzing rider behavior to answer the question: "How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?"

The data used for this analysis was sourced from [divvy-tripdata](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) and the data  [license](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement)

This dashboard visualizes key insights from the Cyclistic bike-share data, including ride length distributions, seasonal usage patterns, and time-of-day trends.


Key insights from the analysis include:

* Casual riders tend to take longer rides compared to annual members.
